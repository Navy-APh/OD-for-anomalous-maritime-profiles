# OD-for-anomalous-maritime-profiles

This repository contains the dataset used in a research study detailed in the conference paper titled "Outlier Detection Approach for Discovering Anomalous Maritime Profiles".

The study presents a statistical analysis on the temporal durations of four types of naval statuses: sailing, docked in port, waiting at anchor and not transmitting AIS data. These durations were extracted from the historical activity of different classes of vessels that passed the Black Sea region. Probability density functions were built for these vessels and all statusesâ€™ durations were fitted into known parametric distributions. Finally, the paper shows the results of multiple outlier detection algorithms that searched for anomalous data in a multivariate manner.
